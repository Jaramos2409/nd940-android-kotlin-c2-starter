# Where to place NASA API Key

There is a file named "apikey.properties" in the root of the project. Within that file you will see the following:

NASA_API_KEY=

Assign the API key to "NASA_API_KEY" in "apikey.properties". The API key must be in double quotes as if it were a string in order for it to work as intended.
